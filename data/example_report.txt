SPECIMEN LABEL(s): Specimen site and medical procedure (such as “Appendix, appendectomy”)

PATIENT HISTORY: Information the clinical team think the Pathologist should know about the
patient, especially as it pertains to the specimen being evaluated.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: The current clinical diagnosis relating to the specimen. If the true diagnosis is
not yet known, the clinical team may provide a list of possible diagnoses (a
"differential diagnosis").

DIAGNOSIS: The final diagnosis made by the Pathologist based on examination
of the tissue specimen visually (grossly) and microscopically, and
in combination with relevant clinical information.

NOTE: The note (sometimes called comment) includes information that may be
helpful to the clinical team. This could be a more detailed description of
what the Pathologist saw in the specimen, an outline of other diagnoses that
were considered, or information that can help with diagnosis and treatment.

SPECIAL TEST RESULTS: The pathology diagnosis may require extra testing such as special tissue stains.
The results from this additional testing could be included here in the report.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: This is a description of the specimen when it was received by pathology. The
description includes measurements (size and sometimes weight), markers of
orientation, anatomic features and any pathologic findings that can be
identified by sight or touch. The gross description also includes a list of all parts
of the specimen that have been submitted for examination under the
microscope.
