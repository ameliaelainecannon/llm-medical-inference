The right kidney contains two separate masses: a 4.2 cm clear cell carcinoma in the upper pole and a 2.1 cm papillary RCC in the lower pole. 
Tumor in the upper pole extends into the renal sinus fat; the lower pole tumor is confined to the kidney parenchyma. 
One hilar lymph node is involved by metastasis. 
No evidence of distant metastases on MRI. 
Immunohistochemistry: CAIX positive in clear cell areas, AMACR positive in papillary areas.
